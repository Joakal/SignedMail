  <h2>How is this possible?</h2>
  <p>This app or website does not make any requests to outside the app or website.</p>
  <p>In fact, if this app is sending connection requests, UNINSTALL/CLOSE IT. WTF. Websites are weird.</p>
  <p>If there are connection attempts or security issues, please email amarkauskas1@gmail.com and not message me publicly</p>
